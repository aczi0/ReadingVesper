## **Hi! I'm Alex,**

I'm an industrial engineer and operations researcher that writes short articles on different personal reflections related to general science, mathematics, artificial intelligence, ethics, technology, society, art and sometimes on personal insights _au go√ªt du jour_.

I built this website without the goal to publish it - to solely write for my own enjoyment and build a knowledge base for my children to look up some day. I recently decided to publish it thinking maybe if I can entertain some people with my articles then why not.

I am a firm believer that you can only be certain that you understand something if you can explain it clearly to a wide audience, and that the world is full of curious things awaiting to be (re)discovered and be inspired by. I hope I can provide some meaningful insights to at least half of the readers that stumble here and maybe spark a conversation or two.

I also run a startup, [Kaster Technologies](kaster.ca "kaster"), with the goal to increase global access to medicine and vaccines through corporate, academic and government partnership and the application of research grade AI.

By running a startup and pursuing my research project, I stumble upon a lot of useful tools that I've categorized per function here:

### **Knowledge Management**

* [Notion](https://www.notion.so/ "Notion") - "Notion is a note-taking software platform designed to help members of companies or organizations manage their knowledge for greater efficiency and productivity."

### **Research Management**

* [Zotero ](https://www.zotero.org/ "Zotero")- "Zotero is a free and open-source reference management software to manage bibliographic data and related research materials, such as PDF files."
* [Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com/ "Overleaf") - "Overleaf is a collaborative cloud-based LaTeX editor used for writing, editing and publishing scientific documents."

### **Website Management**

* [Netlify](www.netlify.com "Netlify") - "Netlify is a remote-first cloud computing company that offers a development platform that includes build, deploy, and serverless backend services for web applications and dynamic websites
* [Forestry](Forestry.io "forestry") - "Content management system for sites built with static site generators."

### **General Programming**

* [Github](github.com "github") - "GitHub, Inc. is an Internet hosting service for software development and version control using Git. It provides the distributed version control of Git plus access control, bug tracking, software feature requests, task management, continuous integration, and wikis for every project"
* [VS Code](visualstudio.com "vscode") - "Visual Studio Code, also commonly referred to as VS Code, is a source-code editor made by Microsoft with the Electron Framework, for Windows, Linux and macOS. Features include support for debugging, syntax highlighting, intelligent code completion, snippets, code refactoring, and embedded Git."
* [Python](python.org "python") - "Python is a high-level, general-purpose programming language. Its design philosophy emphasizes code readability with the use of significant indentation. Python is dynamically-typed and garbage-collected. It supports multiple programming paradigms, including structured, object-oriented and functional programming."

  Some useful libraries I've used:
  * [Google OR-Tools](https://developers.google.com/optimization "google or-tools") - "OR-Tools is an open source software suite for optimization, tuned for tackling the world's toughest problems in vehicle routing, flows, integer and linear programming, and constraint programming."
  * [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/ "Pandas") - "_pandas_ is a fast, powerful, flexible and easy to use open source data analysis and manipulation tool, built on top of the Python programming language."
  * [Numpy](https://numpy.org/ "Numpy") - "NumPy is a library for the Python programming language, adding support for large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices, along with a large collection of high-level mathematical functions to operate on these arrays."
  * Scikit-Learn

### **Prototyping**

* [Airtable](airtable.com "airtable") - "Airtable is a spreadsheet-database hybrid, with the features of a database but applied to a spreadsheet."
* [Appsmith](appsmith.com "appsmith") - "Appsmith is an open-source platform to build, deploy, and maintain internal apps. You can build anything from simple CRUD apps, admin panels, dashboards to custom business apps and complicated multi-step workflows."
* [Google Cloud Functions](https://cloud.google.com/ "Google Cloud Function") - "Cloud Functions has a simple and intuitive developer experience. Just write your code and let Google Cloud handle the operational infrastructure. Develop faster by writing and running small code snippets that respond to events. Streamline challenging orchestration problems by connecting Google Cloud products to one another or third party services using events."

## **This Website**

If you are curious about how I built this website, I wrote about it [here](./posts/aboutthiswebsite). In short, everything you see was designed using HTML/CSS and some JS, using Hugo as a static website generator, Netlify as my host and Forestry as my CMS.
