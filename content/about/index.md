## Hi! I'm Alex,

I'm an industrial engineer and operations researcher that writes short articles on different personal reflections related to general science, mathematics, artificial intelligence, ethics, technology, society, art and sometimes on personal insights _au go√ªt du jour_.

I built this website without the goal to publish it - to solely write for my own enjoyment and build a knowledge base for my children to look up some day. I recently decided to publish it thinking maybe if I can entertain some people with my articles then why not.

I am a firm believer that you can only be certain that you understand something if you can explain it clearly to a wide audience, and that the world is full of curious things awaiting to be (re)discovered and be inspired by. I hope I can provide some meaningful insights to at least half of the readers that stumble here and maybe spark a conversation or two.

If you are curious about how I built this website, I wrote about it [here](./posts/aboutthiswebsite). In short, everything you see was designed using HTML/CSS and some JS, uting Hugo as a static website generator, Netlify as my host and github as my repository.
