## Hi, I'm Alex!

I'm a junior industrial engineer that writes weekly short articles on different 
personal reflections regarding topics in general science, operations research, artificial intelligence, ethics, technology, society, art, finance and what not.

I built this website without the goal to publish it and to solely write for my own enjoyment, and build a knowledge base for my children to look up some day. I recently decided to publish it thinking maybe if I can entertain some people with my articles then why not.
I am a firm believer that you can only be certain that you understand something if you can explain it clearly to a wide audience, and that the world is full of curious things awaiting to be (re)discovered and be inspired by.
If you happen to like what I write, feel free to register to my newsletter to receive a weekly email that bundles up whatever I wrote lately.
