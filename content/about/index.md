# **Hi! I'm Alex,**

I'm an industrial engineer and operations researcher with interests in anything science & engineering. 

This website was built without the intent of publication. It was meant to be a used as a prototype for a project but after tinkering with it I choose to publish it thinking maybe if I can entertain some people with my writings then why not.

I am a firm believer that you can only be certain that you understand something if you can explain it clearly to a wide audience, and that the world is full of curious things awaiting to be (re)discovered and be inspired by. I hope I can provide some meaningful insights to at least half of the readers that stumble here and maybe spark a conversation or two.

Throughout the years, I've come to understand that my profession is not very well known to the public but has had a great impact on society since it's [creation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Industrial_engineering "indus eng"). Thus, I became an Ambassador to my profession through the [Ordre des ingénieurs du Québec](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ordre_des_ing%C3%A9nieurs_du_Qu%C3%A9bec "OIQ"), where I advocate for my field to young students, mentor science fair competitors and support STEM projects in the region of Quebec, Canada.

I also run a startup, [Kaster Technologies](kaster.ca "kaster"), with the goal to increase global access to medicine and vaccines through corporate, academic and government partnership and the application of research grade AI.

## **This Website**

If you are curious about how I built this website, I wrote about it [here](./posts/aboutthiswebsite). In short, everything you see was designed using HTML/CSS and some JS, using Hugo as a static website generator, Netlify as my host and Forestry as my CMS.
