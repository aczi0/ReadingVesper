## [Surrounding ourselves with unread books.](https://bigthink.com/neuropsych/do-i-own-too-many-books/#Echobox=1659313490)

"_Tsundoku_ is the Japanese word for the stack(s) of books you’ve purchased but haven’t read. [Its morphology](https://bigthink.com/culture-religion/7-best-japanese-words?rebelltitem=6#rebelltitem6) combines _tsunde-oku_ (letting things pile up) and _dukosho_ (reading books).

[The word originated](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-44981013) in the late 19th century as a satirical jab at teachers who owned books but didn’t read them."

## A collection of geometric shapes.

## [Some great advice for young scientists and curious people in general.](https://fs.blog/advice-for-young-scientists/)

## [Wikipedia's list of emerging technologies](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_emerging_technologies "wiki")
