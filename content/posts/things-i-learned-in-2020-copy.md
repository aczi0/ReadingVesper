"_Tsundoku_ is the Japanese word for the stack(s) of books you’ve purchased but haven’t read. [Its morphology](https://bigthink.com/culture-religion/7-best-japanese-words?rebelltitem=6#rebelltitem6) combines _tsunde-oku_ (letting things pile up) and _dukosho_ (reading books).

[The word originated](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-44981013) in the late 19th century as a satirical jab at teachers who owned books but didn’t read them."
