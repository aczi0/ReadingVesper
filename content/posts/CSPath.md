# Introduction
If you've done a few computer science tutorials or bootcamp, you've probably heard of (or lived) *tutorial hell*, where each course you take seem to add something new but does not fill the gap between theory and application. I was there, and had a hard time to get out. But I figured out a way to do it and here is where I share my thought processes and guides.

My initial goal was to learn web development so I could build an application that uses operations research abstracted with a nice UI for people to use.

The following guide is an unnoficial syllabus that mimics the computer science syllabus from many great universities (MIT, Stanford, Harvard, Berkley...) and most courses are free or very inexpensive!

It is assumed that the reader has sufficient knowledge of Linear Algebra, Calculus, statistics and basic programming (notion of loops, datatypes, conditionality, OOP).


# Syllabus

## Fundamentals
### [Harvard's CS50](https://online-learning.harvard.edu/course/cs50-introduction-computer-science?delta=0) Introduction to Computer Science
A very good introduction to computer science from the great (if not best) instructor David J. Malan. This course covers the surface of basic programming, python, SQL, web development. 

### [Berkley CS61A](www.cs61a.org) Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs 
This course is by far the best course to help you understand fundamental concepts in programming, regardless of the language. Topics range from Object-Oriented Programming, Functional Programming, Abstraction.

### [Berkley CS61B](www.cs61b.com) Computer Architecture
A great introduction to the hardware that makes up a computer. Bootcamps and tutorials *always* skip this part, but it's fundamental to understand this.
### [Berkley CS61C](www.cs61c.com) Data & Algorithms
Having good fundations in data and algorithm is part of every CS degree out there, but this course is probably the best offered online, for free, available for anyone to take. It's a great course to develop your critical thinking and problem solving skills.
### [MIT's Discrete Mathematics](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-042j-mathematics-for-computer-science-fall-2010/video-lectures/)
I had a discrete mathematics course during my mathematics minor and I believe it's very useful for programming, so here is the best course available for free in that topic, which covers Logic, Proofs, Probabilities and other useful mathematical concepts for coding.
### [MIT's Distributed Systems](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cQP8WApzIQQ&list=PLrw6a1wE39_tb2fErI4-WkMbsvGQk9_UB)
Everything today relies on distributed computing, so if you want to build a website, you ought to learn about it because you will probably be using it.

### [freeCodeCamp](www.freecodecamp.org)
Very good introductory course on web programming that covers HTML/CSS/JavaScript. The learning method is very hand-in-hand and code has been chewed up for you already, but it covers a lot of the basics and it probably the best in its class.

### [FullStackOpen](www.fullstackopen.com)
A more advanced hands-on course on web development that uses JavaScript and covers the entire web stack.

### [Coursera Andrew Ng's Machine Learning I](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning)
Most AI courses give you an overview of ML algorithms and show you how to implement these in Python. This course is algorithm first, then has you implement it in Octave (to abstract Python syntax).

### [Automate the Boring Stuff with Python](https://automatetheboringstuff.com/)
Good course on the applications of Python scripts and offers a good intro to Python. It is given on EdX or as a book.

### [Machine Learning A-Z](https://www.udemy.com/course/machinelearning/)
How to implement popular ML algorithms using Python (I would recommend to wait for this course to be on special, it normally goes for 12-25$)

# Projects

A project that helped me dive in web programming was building this website. I would strongly suggest anyone that wishes to start coding to also have this as a side project.  
I would suggest you to finish the HTML/CSS part of freeCodeCamp.org before doing so. Using HUGO for your website will teach you how to use git and netlify. I shared [here](www.alexclarizio.com/posts/aboutthiswebsite.com) how I managed to do it.  
It will also push you to read a lot of code and with only your ambition to customize the appereance of your website, you will learn how to navigate through files and figure out how things are interconnected, what works and what doesnt in terms of customization (an easy exercice would be to try changing the header by adding a shadow under it!)

# Missing semester - useful tools
Along with all of those tutorials, something that might be missing would be the basics of most tools you will be using later on to develop your own projects, such as:

Code editors
Shell scripting
Version Control
etc...

A great ressource for this would be MIT's [missing semester](https://missing.csail.mit.edu/), which goes in dept on most of these.
