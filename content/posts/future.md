After reading Arthur C. Clark's Profile of the Future, written in 1962, I was inspired to think about how I think the near future (25 years range) will look like. I am no expert in innovation prediction, but I do read a lot and love meself some good science-fiction.

## True, personalized personal assistants
AI systems will have reached a stage where they will understand you very well by having learned a lot out of your behaviours and decision making methods, and will have created a model of you. It will then be able to assist you on a more personal level. Be it running a million-year simulation on specific decisions you are thinking about in a fraction of a nanosecond, or acting as a personal assistant and manage your schedule efficiently, make calls on your behalf, and organize your thoughts.

## AI in Learning & schools
You will be able to have a repertoire of your own knowledge and point to what you want to learn, and an AI system will create an optimized path towards this goal. For younger children, personalized development will allow them to navigate to what spikes their interest, while giving them general education so they don't become specialized early in their lives. The problem of knowledge from teachers will be solved by AI assistants, they will become operators of those systems and guide how learning will happen on a more strategic level.

## Space travel & logistics
We will have figured out how to mass produce rockets to go to space, hence it will be a lot cheaper to travel, enabling a new set of businesses to flourish, such as asteroid mining, which might create economic instability (for example, stumbling uppon a trillion-ton titanium astroid). Space tourism will also be more accessible to the common folk. Space real estate will be a thing (personal orbital stations). Floating fuel stations, solar arrays that beams energy back to earth, astroid deflectors, and of course, space will be militarized. Sattelite data & imagery will become of comon use by more than just governments and military. Farmers will use it to have real-time data on their crops. Emergency Services will use it to gage risks and plan. 

## Nanorobots
They will start their way into our lives in various forms. 
One of the first disruption will probably happen in the healthcare industry, where nanorobots could be used to deliver precision surgery within the body without the need for surgeon to open the body. Another case would be the targeted distribution of medication. Swarms of nanorobots could also work in hivemode to build and fuse grain materials into structure (think of termites building their towers). 

## Wireless energy transmission
Energy will be extracted from the ionosphere (using electrons that are stagnating from the diffusion of solar storms) and redistributed without the need of wires. Part of the population will be against this out of fear that the energy 'floating around' will affect human cells to a whole new level. It will be very difficule to pursue research on the impact of this technology on human health, as it will become widespread faster than the institutions responsible to regulate it. This is allow for massive scaling of construction and manufacturing endeavors.

## Interconnectivity
Everyday things will now be interconnected to an *intelligent* and self-sufficient grid that will be programmed to the users needs. Right now, this is called the Internet of Things. Later, it will just become the *interlink*. 

## Nuclear energy
Nuclear fusion will have proven to be feasible and we will have (hopefully) steered off of oil-based energy, and Nuclear will become the main source of power.

## Transportation
Cars will all be electric, and will be charged wirelessly. Self-driving will be an option on all of them, and some people will still cling to the fossil-fuel models as a way to keep their freedom. 

## Dyson spheres
In your present's future, there will be some talks about Dyson spheres, which aims to harvest a large amount of potential energy of stars. This will be the biggest technological feat humans will ever embark on.
