# On ideas

"If you are in a place that suppresses implementing new ideas, do you keep having them?

An obstacle downstream propages upstream. If you're not allowed to implement new ideas, you stop having them. And vice versa: when you can do whatever you want, you have more ideas about what to do. So working for yourself makes your brain more powerful in the same way a low restriction exhaust system makes an engine more powerful.

I spend a lot of time thinking about the Hamming question - "What are the most important problems in your field, and why aren't you working on them?". I feel people don't think about this enough. But for those who do, it is a fantastic way to develop 'problem taste', that helps you think independently, ponder about the future and how the industry and technology will evolve, and pinpoint how you can 'attack' it.

# On doing deep research

- Read a lot of papers, and assess them critically. If possible, discuss them with others who have deeper knowledge of the subject.
- Work in a research group with other people working on similar topics. That way you can absorb their experiences as well as your own.
- Seek advice from experienced researchers on what to work on. There's no shame in working on ideas suggested by other people. Ideas are cheap, and there are lots of them in the air. Your skill comes in when you decide which one to work on, and how well you execute on it.
- Spend time reflecting on what research is useful and fruitful. Think about questions like: When is theory useful? When are empirical results transferable? What causes some ideas to get wide uptake, whereas others are forgotten? What are the trends in your field? Which lines of work will make the other ones obsolete?

The first 3 points relate to optimizing your environment and getting input from other researchers, whereas the last point is something you do alone. 

Do goal-oriented research.
