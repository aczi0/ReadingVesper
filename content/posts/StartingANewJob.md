A small insight on the approach I take for starting a new job.  

Beforehand, learn as much as you can about the business domain with your own research.  Same thing goes for its industry. Who are the winners? Why? Who is on the executive team? What are their professional track? Education? Accomplishments? Is the domain exploding, stagnating, degrading? Why?

On the job, be observant in learning and ask questions, many of them, if not **all** of them. You don't want to be three months in and ask a question about some basic in-company process and then have people ask how you managed three months without knowing this.  

Don't advocate for perceived improvements on proceses, the team, or tools, until you understand how the current situation has evolved to how it is now.  

Be the person that notices real problems the business faces, rather than to dwelve on minute concerns that new employees tend to point out in good will as an attempt to display their ambition and knowledge on day one.  

Let your actions be the carrier of your past experiences gathered over time.  

Try to be up on your feet faster than you think they are expecting you to. Learn things by yourself, be ressourceful, don't wait for formal introductions to other team members, go forward and do it yourself. Show initiative, but know your limits. Go outside of your comfort zone.

Try to understand the company culture and how things are done internally. How do people go about change, and changing things? How is innovation carried? What is the mission and values? Are those really carried through the entire corporation? Who are the true leaders, and detractors.

Figure out what is expected of you, and how feedback is given. Understand how is success defined, and what is measured in terms of individual and global performance. Ask for this early on.  

Always carry a short, medium and long term plan in head, regarding the time at this company and for your professional track, and never lose sight of this.

Also, be genuine.
