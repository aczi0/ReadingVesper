A small insight on the approach to take for starting a new job.  

Beforehand, learn as much as you can about the business domain with your own research.  

Be observant in learning and ask questions, many of them. You don't want to be three months in and ask a question about some basic in-company process and then have people ask how you managed three months without knowing this.  

Don't advocate for perceived improvements on proceses, the team, or tools, until you understand how the current situation has evolved to how it is now.  

Be the person that notices real problems the business faces, rather than to dwelve on minute concerns that new employees tend to point out in good will as an attempt to display their ambition and knowledge on day one.  

Let your actions be the carrier of your past experiences gathered over time.  

Try to be up on your feet faster than you think they are expecting you to. Learn things by yourself, be ressourceful, don't wait for formal introductions to other team members, go forward and do it yourself. Show initiative, but know your limits. 

Try to understand the company culture and how things are done internally. How do people go about change, and changing things? 

Figure out what is expected of you, and how feedback is given. Ask for this early on.  

Always carry a short, medium and long term plan in head.

Also, be genuine.
