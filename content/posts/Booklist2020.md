I am an avid reader, and I'm the kind of person who likes to keep his books in a physical form. I tried to read through a tablet and an iPad, but nothing beats paper. It also feels good to place a new book on the bookshelf, as I tend to buy more than my capacity to read (this leads to me reading a few books at the same time, which works but might not be optimal). In order to keep track, I like to first highlight important passages of my books. Then, when the time for writing comes, I would take those highlights, and summarize them myself, which helps me remember and enforces the learning process through synthesization.

## Business
### *The Goal by Eli Goldratt*  
This book is a longtime favorite and was introduced to me by a fellow industrial engineer during my first semester in University. It tells the tale of an engineer that is faced with semingly complicated and convoluted problem within his manufacturing plant. The author then uses an approach that, at that time, would have been deemed coming from *le champ droit*. Applying the underlying foundation of industrial engineer, the main character figures out solutions using system thinking, constraint based problem solving, lean manufacturing and an holistic approach to the covolution. It was a great introduction to what then became my own profession.

## Science Fiction
### *Contact by Carl Sagan* 

Carl Sagan was my first exposure to the world of scientific skeptisism, before I even knew I was interested in the subject. The book depics the conflict between politicians, religious leaders and the scientific community when an astrophysicist discovers a signal sent to Earth from another solar system, Vega.  The story is very well written and makes no way for any scientific innacuracy.  

### *Three-Body Problem by Cixin Liu*  
A very well written introduction to the trilogy, the Three-Body Problem is considered one of the leading *hard* sci-fi book of the decade. It takes place in China where humans have made contact with an advanced civilisation that communicates through a simulation game where the users, selected from the best of the best, have to solve the three-body problem (which is a well known physics problem). Without going into too many details, if you are interested in sci-fi novels that push your understanding of our own physical models of the universe, this one is for you.
