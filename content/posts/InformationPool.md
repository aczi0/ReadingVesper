In order to stay up to date with anything, you need some diverse, reliable information sources that are readily accessible to you. I have come across a diverse array of "information pooling" platforms and I now wish to share with you the one that I've found to be most useful. (This page was not sponsored by any companies listed below, and I am not receiving any incentive to publish this article.)

[Feedly]() is a very simple tool that let's you agglomerate websites that have RSS feeds. You can also create *feeds* that let's you store multiple websites within one category. 

[Pocket]() let's me keep track of some interesting articles that I want to go over later, such as when I'm on an airplane or using public transportation. A great feature is that you can t ag your aticles to keep track of the subject matter.
