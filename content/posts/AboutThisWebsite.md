I started this website with very little knowledge of how HTML/CSS/JS works. Having done [Havard's CS50]() course on computer science and a college level C++ class, and working on [freecodecamp.com](www.freecodecamp.com) most of what I knew was basic theoritical knowledge (my exams were done on paper at school...!). After looking at how Wordpress worked, I decided to learn more about websites and went with a static website generator. 

## Setup

### Hugo
I initially started learning about web development using django to then gave gave a try to HTML+CSS+JavaScript using the interactive platform freeCodeCamp.org, where I learned the basics to navigate prefabricated websited and tinker around to accomodate them for my own needs. I then started using Wordpress, but I quickly realized that I was limited fully to their platform and services. 

Enter [Hugo](www.gohugo.io).  
An open source framework that allows you to generate (in less than a few second) a generic static website template along with all the files you need to get started for your own blog. A multitude of community built themes are available and, if you can read and write HTML and CSS, it is quite easy to adapt those to your own needs.

I used this [tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtIqKaDlqXo) given by Mike Dane, who guides you through the exercice of building a simple website with a simple theme. After this, you will definetly be able to start your own and tinker around with a different theme, organize your posts, menus, visual style and much more.

### Visual Studio Code
In order to read the modify the files generated by Hugo, you need a code editor. I decided to use Visual Studio Code, as it is free and very easy to use.  here's the link to [download](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) and [how to get started](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/introvideos/basics) to get you up and coding.

### Github
After building and editing my website, I needed a system to do version control, which avoids me from having many files named _v2, _v3, _final, _final2, _final_final etc... (I'm sure many of you had this issue with your excel files!) I needed a way to also put those files online without having to deal with renaming so that I could then find a hosting service for publishing. [Github](github.com) serves that purpose well as I can *push* my code to my repository and *pull* it from another computer, write content, and *push* it back to the main repo. It is also very easy to integrate Netlify, the free hosting service that I use. See [here](https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/) to get started with Github.

### Netlify
Finally, I had to find a reliable and free website hosting service that could hold my static website with no hassle. [Netlify](www.netlify.com) was able to satisfy those needs quite easily and I would recommend anyone starting to go with them for their hosting services. By having your repo on github, Netlify can create a bridge and host your files in a jiffy. Hugo has a nice [guide](https://gohugo.io/hosting-and-deployment/hosting-on-netlify/) on how to host on Netlify. There are also many ressources online that guide you through this process, because you might get some obscure errors when deploying, but fear not, the Hugo and Netlify community is very active and willing to help! Also chances are someone else had your bug before and the solution is in their forums.

## Markdown
Your posts will be writted in markdown, which is a language used to add formatting elements to plain-text documents. It's interesting to know that it was cocreated by Aaron Swartz.

## Tutorial
One day I will create a tutorial on how to build a website and having it hosted in less than 30 minutes. Until then, stay tuned.
