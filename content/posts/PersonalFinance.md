## Lazy Finances

In any decision making process, there are a few critical steps necessary to take before taking action: figuring out the objective, the constraints, what information is needed and what information is available.

So before I started investing my money in the market, I wanted to have clear visibility on my financial health in this manner.

I use an Excel tool that combines all of my income, expenses, budgets and investments. The file is updated once a month and it automatically gives me a glimpse (and an in depth view) of my finances. The trick is to maintain a category of the income and expense types so you can then do monthly grouping and compare it to your budget bucket.

This lets me see how much money I can afford to save/spend in the future as I 'allocate' future earned money to my budgeted expenses. Along with my savings and investments, I can compile it all to track my net worth and build scenarios such as 'how long will it take for me to save for X', 'what would be the impact of Y if I make X less during these months due to Z expenses' and such. It also lets me know how much I can afford to invest more on a monthly basis.

Some actionable metrics that I follow are:

* Net Savings Magin (%): Let's me know the % of my income that goes into savings.
* FIRE %: Let's me know my progress towards financial independence (more on that below)
* Income and Expense budget variance (avg% and total%): Let's me know on average how far in or out I am of my budgets, and on a global level (12 months)

All data entry is still either manual or a copy & paste of .csv statements from my bank, since I didn't find a way to automate the extraction from my bank.

Now, if we go one step further, I will detail the strategies used that guide my methods.

### Income & Expenses

You have some control over your income and expenses. My goal is to balance my income based on my professional goals and available opportunities, and minimize expenses by living frugally; on a 'want or need' basis. Live frugally, as in ask yourself if what you are purchasing is a _need_ or a _want_. Really ask yourself this and be honest, it's fine to want things, just be conscious of the ratio of want/need things you buy, and balance it out.

### Savings

Most banks in my province offer very similar rates (around 0.5% - 0.1%). I found a website called [Ratehub](www.ratehub.ca) that compiles a list of Canadian banking services with all their rates and fees. With this, I found out that a bank has a special online HISA with a rate of 1.5%!

### Investing

The philosophy I follow is simple and straight forward. In all my research and knowledge of finance (which is limited to the equivalent of an undergraduate level of the matter), nothing beats **time in the market.** The most efficient way I found to grow my wealth over my lifetime with minimal effort is to follow the [canadian couch potato](www.canadiancouchpotato.com) model. I highly recommend anyone reading this to take a look. In short, the strategy aims to invest frequently in the **total world market**, for a very long time, to harness the power of **compounding interests**, and never try to **time the market.**

How do you invest in the total world market, you may ask? First off, you need to have access to a trading platform. Many exist, and in Canada two popular ones are Questrade and Wealthsimple. I choose Questrade as when I started Wealthsimple had a different structure and I am still very satisfied with their services and fees, but both are very similar. Then, you want to setup a TFSA account and figure out how much contribution room you have. Once you have these, you will want to learn about Exchange Traded Funds (ETF). You can think of those securities as a basket of stocks. You like tech companies? There's an ETF for that. You want to follow the clean energy wave? There's an ETF for that. Hell, there's even an ETF that follows Work From Home (it's ticket is WFH) basket of companies! So you guessed it, if you want to invest in the total world market, it would be very inefficient to invest in every stock in every country, so you would be better off buying an ETF that does this for you. But which one?

In Canada, we have two main financial companies that offer these types of products. Banks like BMO and Desjardins also do, but most of their fees are xx% times higher than what Blackrock and Vanguard offer, for very similar products.

Before going into the actual ETFs, there s something important to understand. Stocks and bonds allocation. Stocks are shares of a company, and are known to be risky, and can then provide great returns. Bonds on the contrary, are like loans to a company or government, that provide more stable, but lower returns. ETFs can be comprised of both of these. So depending on your risk tolerance (you can test yourself here), you could be better off with an ETF that has 80% stocks (equity) and 20% bonds (fixed income).

Now back to Vanguard and Blackrock. In order to invest in the total world market, there are a few securities (financial products) available for you to look into. If you are a young professional, you then have time to recover from market downs. So an ETF such as XEQT or VEQT would be favorable to you, giving you more growth potential (100% stocks 0% bonds). At around 40 years old, something like XGRO or VGRO (80% stocks 20% bonds) will give you more stable returns than the previous ETFs.

Why total market? Because on average, you will get an annual return of 10%, which is the average increase in the total world market. On the long run, nothing beats this, except if you have access to the Medaillion Fund by Renaissance Technology or another wealthy hedge fund that gives you 20%+ yearly, but it's probably not the case (most of them require a minimum bank balance of 1M$ and a salary of over 300k$).

### The 4% rule

How do you figure out how much money to save for an early retirement? The 4% rule is a simple way to calculate this. Take your yearly expenses and add a buffer of 20% to it. Then figure out the amount needed which 4% of it will generate passive returns that will equate your yearly expenses. Because in the end, as your asset allocation (the ratio of stocks and bonds in your portfolio) will tip on the bonds side (to provide safer, lower returns) and they normally provide a steady 4-6% return that you can then withdraw, which will cover your expenses!

What would you do if your living expenses were paid and you could then afford to stop working for money and attend to your passions? This is the 4% rule.

### Insights on day trading, fundamentals and behavioral finance

There are many other strategies to investing, and I will (and can't) go in depth into each and every one of them, but the book "Random Walk on Wall Street" does a great job at it. 

In short, day trading refers to trading using technical indicators and graphs (candle charts, volume, and other statistical metrics). It serves a promise that you can 'model' a specific stock and can use past data and metrics to 'predict' it's movement and act accordingly. I picked up a few things about day trading and for me these are enough to convince me not to use this strategy:

* There is a flood of people on social media pushing their courses and tell you to BUY LOW and SELL HIGH and REPEAT!! I have one thing to say to this:

> You make more money selling advice that following it
>
> _- Steve Forbes_

* There is (also) a flood of automatic programs that use heavily sophisticated algorithms to buy and sell at rates that far exceed what humans can comprehend (micro seconds transactions) so by the time you decide to execute an order, 1,000 bots made a move against each other and made the ticker move in a direction that you haven't notice and would technically probably change your strategy if you had, but you couldn't. A very futile game.
* If you think you can predict a stock price movement, you must have learned about stochastic processes and hidden markov chains, right? 
* You are up against hedge funds that are specializing in doing high frequency trading bots that far exceed the power and reach of the bots spoken on point 2 that are build by amateur retail investors.

## Debt

Pay off your debt regularly and as a priority. And don't spend money you don't have for things you don't need! (Sound simple, but without knowing how much you have and spend, this can be a steep well to get out from)

## Credit

For credit cards, I use one that returns x% per year, with the lowest fees. Only use it if I have money to pay it back. Take advantage of everything your credit card provides, you are paying for those after all.

## Savings

## Investing

For investing, the asset allocation (% of stocks and bonds) will depend on your risk tolerance and your situation.  I use the [canadian couch potato](www.canadiancouchpotato.com) principle. The goal is to purchase an asset allocation fund that auto re-balances, can set up auto purchases and DRIP. With this fund, you can sit back and keep purchasing the fund, regardless of the market conditions. **Timing the market is futile** and time consuming, unless you are a professional investor that does day trading, because if not, you will soon realize that everything is already priced in. In the long run, the more time you are in the market, the wealthier you will become, thanks to the power of compounding interest.

## The 4% rule

I follow the 4% rule, which means that I want to save an amount of money for which 4% of it will generate passive income equal to my yearly expenses. As you grow older, your equities fund will have to move into safer investments (bonds) which have returns of about 4-6%.

## Educated Guesses

Never invest money you're not ready to lose, for example your house down payment. Learn as much as you can before investing on a financial product, no one has a crystal ball so without any knowledge, investing is the same as gambling. By understanding more you can make educated guess as to where certain industries or companies are heading and adjust your investments accordingly. For the example above of investing your house down payment, don't fool around with this and try to make an extra 20%. Imagine losing 10%, the setback would be counted in years. Put it in a high interest savings account for the time being.

## Equity Investing

I budget about 5% of my disposable income in equity. I enjoy doing this, because it allows me to invest in companies I believe will perform in the short or long term. The best way to learn about investing is to get your hands dirty with a small amount of money. Beware of the fees! I use [Questrade](www.Questrade.ca) as my trading platform.

## Crypto

1% of my income goes into cryptocurrency. I believe in the original cause, altough now it's becoming more of a tool for the underground economy to flourish, and of the massive pump and dump scheme of september 2018, I still have some hope for it to become something bigger and global. It also became a new diversification asset, like a new 'gold', but unlike gold, it is massively volatile.
