Simple guidelines on personal finance that I follow. test

## Finance Overview

Excel is your friend! I budget my finances once a year and review it every month in case something comes up. I categorize my expenses (not in great detail, but enough to have an idea of where my money goes ex: rent, gas, insurance groceries...). I then match this to my budget to see how I'm doing. This lets me see how much money I can afford to save/spend in the future as I 'allocate' future earned money to my budgeted expenses. Along with my savings and investments, I can compile it all to track my net worth and build scenarios such as 'how long will it take for me to save for XYZ', 'what would be the impact of Y if I make X less during these months due to Z expenses' and such. It also lets me know how much I can afford to invest more on a monthly basis.

## Control

You have some control over your income and expenses. My goal is to maximize my income based on my professional goals, and minimize expenses by living frugally, on a 'want or need' basis. When the market is going down, I try to see which company has strong fundamentals and is just going through a rough patch and invest in it, then sell when things go back to normal. I normally don't put in a lot but since 2018 I was able to make an extra 20-50% return, which includes a 5% loss on some of those investments.

## Visibility

Before trying to take decisions on how to manage your expenses and budget, you need visibility. A simple spreadsheet helps, don't spend money on products that can do the same. Having simple metrics to provide a quick glance at the health of your finances is also a good idea. Such metrics can be 'Month to date expenses', 'Year to date expenses', 'Savings Margin'. I can also visually see how my expenses are split, and how my investments are doing.

## Debt

Pay off your debt regularly and as a priority. And don't spend money you don't have for things you don't need! (Sound simple, but without knowing how much you have and spend, this can be a steep well to get out from)

## Want vs Need

Live frugally, as in ask yourself if what you are purchasing is a _need_ or a _want_. Really ask yourself this and be honest, it's fine to want things, just be conscious of the ratio of want/need things you buy, and balance it.

## Credit

For credit cards, I use one that returns x% per year, with the lowest fees. Only use it if I have money to pay it back. Take advantage of everything your credit card provides, you are paying for those after all.

## Savings

For savings, I use the highest HISA available in my province. Shop around, it's definetly worth it.

## Investing

For my investing, the asset allocation (% of stocks and bonds) will depend on your risk tolerance and your situation.  I use the [canadian couch potato](www.canadiancouchpotato.com) principles. The goal is to purchase an asset allocation fund that auto rebalances, can sets up auto purchases and DRIP. With this fund, you can sit back and keep purchasing the fund, regardless of the market conditions. **Timing the market is futile** and time consuming, unless you are a professional investor that does day trading, because if not, you will soon realize that everything is already priced in. You think $TSLA will go down in a few weeks? The current stock price already reflects this.

## The 4% rule

I follow the 4% rule, which means that I want to save an amount of money for which 4% of it will generate passive income equal to my yearly expenses. As you grow older, your equities fund will have to move into safer investments (bonds) which have returns of about 4-6%.

## Educated Guesses

Never invest money you're not ready to lose, for example your house down payment. Learn as much as you can before investing on a financial product, no one has a crystal ball so without any knowledge, investing is the same as gambling. By understanding more you can make educated guess as to where certain industries or companies are heading and adjust your investments accordingly. For the example above of investing your house down payment, don't fool around with this and try to make an extra 20%. Imagine losing 10%, the setback is counted in years. Put it in a high interest savings account for the time being. Shop around, some banks offer great savings rate compared to others.

## Equity Investing

I budget about 5% of my disposable income in equity. I enjoy doing this, because it allows me to invest in companies I believe will perform in the short or long term. The best way to learn about investing is to get your hands dirty with a small amount of money. Beware of the fees!

## Crypto

1% of my total income goes into cryptocurrency. I believe in the original cause, altough now it's becoming more of a tool for the underground economy to flourish, and of the massive pump and dump scheme of september 2018, I still have some hope for it to become something bigger and global.
