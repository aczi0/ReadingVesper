Simple guidelines on personal finance that I follow.

## Finance Overview

I try to manage my finances like I would run a company, with a lot of actionable data. Every month I compile my income, expenses and investments.  I build a budget for the whole year which I review every 6 months. I categorize my expenses (not in great detail, but enough to have an idea of where my money goes ex: rent, gas, insurance groceries...). I then match this to my budget to see how I'm doing. This lets me see how much money I can afford to save/spend in the future as I 'allocate' future earned money to my budgeted expenses. Along with my savings and investments, I can compile it all to track my net worth and build scenarios such as 'how long will it take for me to save for X', 'what would be the impact of Y if I make X less during these months due to Z expenses' and such. It also lets me know how much I can afford to invest more on a monthly basis.

Some actionable metrics that I follow are:

* Net Savings Magin (%): Let's me know the % of my income that goes into savings.
* FIRE %: Let's me know my progress towards financial independence (more on that below)
* Income and Expense budget variance (avg% and total%): Let's me know on average how far in or out I am of my budgets, and on a global level (12 months)

## Control

You have some control over your income and expenses. My goal is to maximize my income based on my professional goals, and minimize expenses by living frugally; on a 'want or need' basis. Live frugally, as in ask yourself if what you are purchasing is a _need_ or a _want_. Really ask yourself this and be honest, it's fine to want things, just be conscious of the ratio of want/need things you buy, and balance it out.

## Visibility

Before trying to take decisions on how to manage your expenses and budget, you need visibility. A simple spreadsheet helps, don't spend money on products that can do the same until your situation becomes too complex and time consuming (and at that point you might want to hire a professional).

## Debt

Pay off your debt regularly and as a priority. And don't spend money you don't have for things you don't need! (Sound simple, but without knowing how much you have and spend, this can be a steep well to get out from)

## Credit

For credit cards, I use one that returns x% per year, with the lowest fees. Only use it if I have money to pay it back. Take advantage of everything your credit card provides, you are paying for those after all.

## Savings

For savings, I use the highest HISA available in my province. Shop around, it's definetly worth it. [Ratehub](www.ratehub.ca) has a list of Canadian banking services with all their returns and fees.

## Investing

For investing, the asset allocation (% of stocks and bonds) will depend on your risk tolerance and your situation.  I use the [canadian couch potato](www.canadiancouchpotato.com) principle. The goal is to purchase an asset allocation fund that auto re-balances, can set up auto purchases and DRIP. With this fund, you can sit back and keep purchasing the fund, regardless of the market conditions. **Timing the market is futile** and time consuming, unless you are a professional investor that does day trading, because if not, you will soon realize that everything is already priced in. In the long run, the more time you are in the market, the wealthier you will become, thanks to the power of compounding interest.

## The 4% rule

I follow the 4% rule, which means that I want to save an amount of money for which 4% of it will generate passive income equal to my yearly expenses. As you grow older, your equities fund will have to move into safer investments (bonds) which have returns of about 4-6%.

## Educated Guesses

Never invest money you're not ready to lose, for example your house down payment. Learn as much as you can before investing on a financial product, no one has a crystal ball so without any knowledge, investing is the same as gambling. By understanding more you can make educated guess as to where certain industries or companies are heading and adjust your investments accordingly. For the example above of investing your house down payment, don't fool around with this and try to make an extra 20%. Imagine losing 10%, the setback would be counted in years. Put it in a high interest savings account for the time being.

## Equity Investing

I budget about 5% of my disposable income in equity. I enjoy doing this, because it allows me to invest in companies I believe will perform in the short or long term. The best way to learn about investing is to get your hands dirty with a small amount of money. Beware of the fees! I use [Questrade](www.Questrade.ca) as my trading platform.

## Crypto

1% of my income goes into cryptocurrency. I believe in the original cause, altough now it's becoming more of a tool for the underground economy to flourish, and of the massive pump and dump scheme of september 2018, I still have some hope for it to become something bigger and global. It also became a new diversification asset, like a new 'gold', but unlike gold, it is massively volatile.
