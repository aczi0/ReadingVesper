# Introduction
There are many guides out there on how to manage your personal finances. I collected a few of these and created my own which are organized as sections below.

# Overview 
I budget monthly using a simple Excel Spreadsheet. I categorize my expenses and link them to the budget automatically then do an overview of my net worth on a month to date and year to date basis.  I use some simple statistics to get a quick glance at the health of my finances.  I then can know how much I can invest in the future and plan for my expenses.

## Control
 You have control over your income and expenses. My goal is to maximize my income based on my professional goals, and minimize expenses by living frugally.
## Visibility
Before trying to take decisions on how to manage your expenses and budget, you need visibility. A simple spreadsheet helps, don't spend money on products that can do the same. Having simple metrics to provide a quick glance at the health of your finances is also a good idea.
## Debt
Pay off your debt regularly and as a priority. 
## Want vs Need
Live frugally, as in ask yourself if what you are purchasing is a *need* or a *want*. I rarely buy things I *want* except if I allow a budget for it.
## Credit 
For credit cards, I use one that returns x% per year, and only use it if I have money to pay it back. I never spend money I don't have. 
## Savings
For savings, I use the highest HISA available in my province. Shop around, it's definetly worth it.
## Investing
For my investing, the asset allocation (% of stocks and bonds) will depend on your risk tolerance and your situation.  I use the [canadian couch potato](www.canadiancouchpotato.com) principles. The goal is to purchase an asset allocation fund that auto rebalances, can sets up auto purchases and DRIP. With this fund, you can sit back and keep purchasing the fund, regardless of the market conditions. Timing the market is futile and time consuming, unless you are a professional investor that does day trading, because if not, you will soon realize that everything is already priced in. You think $TSLA will go down in a few weeks? The current stock price already reflects this. 
## The 4% rule
I follow the 4% rule, which means that I want to save an amount of money for which 4% of will generate passive income equal to my yearly expenses. As you grow older, your equities fund will have to move into safer investments (bonds) which have returns of about 4-6%.
## Educated Guesses
Never invest money you're not ready to lose, for example your house down payment. Put it in a high interest savings account for the time being. Shop around, some banks offer great savings rate compared to others.
## Equity Investing
I budget about 5% of my disposable income in equity. I enjoy doing this, because it allows me to invest in companies I believe will perform in the short or long term. The best way to learn about investing is to get your hands dirty with a small amount of money. Beware of the fees!
## Crypto
1% of my total income goes into cryptocurrency.
