# Some background...
I was trained as an Industrial Engineering and the discipline is very focused on decision science, manufacturing, inventory control and management principles all wrapped around lean thinking. Since these are all taught as systems-first principles (top-down vs bottom-up like most other traditional engineering practice), the knowledge can be transfered to many different discipline, as most of them work in similar ways fundamentally.

# Do more with less
 When looking at the reach of this applicability, think input -Â­> process -> output. The goal of IEs is to optimize the process part - use less input to get the same output (efficiency) or use the same input to get more output (productivity).

 # Bumping Shoulders
So it's easy to imagine that as an IE you get to work on *big picture* problems. There are a few advantages to this. One being that you can quickly bump shoulders with higher management and start using your 'systems' thinking as a sounding board to them. With this, you can then be exposed to many true business problems. 

One caveat is that during the IE education, algorithms that you learn are not meant to be built on using web interfaces or apps. They are meant to serve as hidden analysis done by you and will be served as a powerpoint presentation with some tables and graphs to the management team. 

I realized quickly that it would only make sense if these passive reporting decision-making algorithms could be turned into dynamic tools that could be operated by people with some knowledge of computers by only abstracting the algorithm part and serving them some form and premade graphics and tables.

In order to do so, I would need to make sure I build a prototype to proove that my idea is worth it, and find a few clients that would be willing to try it out. Then get their feedback and reiterate etc (more on this [here](www.theleanstartup.com)).

There are two ways to go about this. Either you come from a software engineering/computer science background and you build it from ground up, or you rely on one to do it for you. Because I liked programming in university but never had a chance to develop a dynamic website, I decided that I wanted to learn to program it myself, at least to the prototype level - to have something to show - and then probably hire professionals to build it. 

So I decided to document and share my learning path, in the hopes that I can actually get something out of this learning adventure and that maybe it could help someone else sharing similar goals but has some problems figuring out where to start.

I have blended different learning curriculums, both from universities' syllabus of computer science and softwar engineering, and of MOOCs.
