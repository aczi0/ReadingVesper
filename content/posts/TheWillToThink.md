> Motivation is at least as important as method for the serious thinker. Shockley believed... *the essential element for succesful work in any field was "the will to think"*. This was a phrase he learned from the nuclear physicist Enrico Fermi and never forgot. "In these four words, "Shockley wrote later," [Fermi] distilled the essence of a very significant insight: A competent thinker will be reluctant to commit himself to the effort that tedious and precise thinking demands -- he will lack "the will to think" -- unless he has the conviction that something worthwhile will be done with the results of his efforts." The discipline of competent thinking is important throughout life... [Source]().

When I'm presented with a new problem, I try, as much as possible, to approach it as a whole and as a sum of elements, as a *system*. Not every problem can be seen as a system, but once in the scope of my practice normally do, and these include global corporation strategies, decision making processes, manufacturing processes and lean enterprise integrations. 

The knowledge gathered from this can be transfered to everyday thinking and see things as processes, which allows you to make different conclusions that sometimes appear impossible to get to from within the said process.

These systems sometimes interact together, leading it to evolve over time. I've noticed that people, in general, even very smart people, are terrible at understanding how things, especially systems, evolve over time. This is why I will try to make this understanding a little bit better, in the hopes that it will provide a way to understand these systems better. *Note: my view on systems was heavily influenced by my education in industrial engineering and a few great books on the topic, one being [Thinking in systems]().*

## Seeing things as a whole

When faced with any problems, it is easy to go head first with your first insticts, backed by your own assumptions, and try to find a solution right away. This can often lead to a shortsighted solution, or a patch, to the problem at hand. But what if the problem comes back? Or is just transfered?

This approach is normally called the hollistic approach.  By seeing the thing at hand as a whole, you can approach it from the top, and simmer it down by blocks to investigate what lies under, in order to understand, objectively, what constitutes it. This way, every time you discover a new block, you can 1. understand how it works and interacts with its surrounding and 2. understand its purpose. Then, you keep digging while keeping the whole in mind, until all the blocks are uncovered and you have a solid grasp of the problem at hand.

## How to go about improving

Once all the blocks are uncovered, you can go back top to see if they really bring value to the
