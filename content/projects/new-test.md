title = "What is Operations Research?"

+++
Operations Research (OR) is one of those fields that is being constantly being placed in different departments. For example, at my university, it's a branch of industrial engineering. In business school, it's under data science and business intelligence. In some other universities, it's under the computer science department. Even the name changes. It is called decision science, operations management, mathematical optimization and operations research. But none of these convey the real purpose of the field.

Here's a few descriptions, explained as if the audience was 5, 20, as an undergraduate and a graduate student:

**ELI5**: Operations research is a way of using math and computer science to help people and businesses make better decisions.

**ELI20**: Operations research is a field that uses mathematical and analytical techniques to help make better decisions in areas such as business, engineering, and the military. It involves using computers to solve complex problems and make predictions about the future.

**ELIUndergrad**: Operations research is a discipline that focuses on the use of advanced analytical and mathematical techniques to help make better decisions in complex situations. It is often used in fields such as business, engineering, and the military, and involves the use of computers to solve problems and make predictions. Operations research analysts use a variety of methods, such as optimization, simulation, and statistical analysis, to help organizations make better decisions and improve their operations.

**ELIGrad**: Operations research is a branch of mathematics that deals with the optimization of complex systems. It is concerned with the development and use of mathematical models and techniques for the design, analysis, and improvement of systems and processes. Operations research has a wide range of applications, including in fields such as business, engineering, and the military. It involves the use of advanced analytical and mathematical tools, such as optimization algorithms, simulation models, and statistical analysis, to help organizations make better decisions and improve their operations.
